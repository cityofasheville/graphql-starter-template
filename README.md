# GraphQL Starter Template

This is the starter template for all City of Asheville web API projects. It contains the basic functionality of a GraphQL API, plus authentication, logging and caching. It is intended to be paired with a front-end application based on the [React Starter Template](https://github.com/cityofasheville/react-starter-template). 

To build and run, clone this repository, then run:
````
yarn
yarn start
````

Applications should should fork rather than clone this project so that updates to the template can be pulled. The application-specific API code should all be added in the ```api``` subdirectory.
